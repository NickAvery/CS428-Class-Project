<h2> CVE Network Protocol </h2>

by Clinton Jeffery, with help
<p>

This document describes version 0.3 of the CVE Network Protocol as of
3/11/10.
The document has historically served as a design (read: wishful thinking)
document, which the implementation has never achieved.  Various
additions to the implementation have not been incorporated here,
limiting the usefulness of this document.  This situation is under repair.
<p>

At present
CVE uses an ASCII, line-oriented human-readable text protocol, similar to
a chat or MUD protocol.  At present, CVE uses TCP only.  At present, CVE is
a monolithic server.


<h3> Requirements </h3>


The CVE protocol has the following requirements:

<ul>

<li> The protocol must support a rich set of chat capabilities:
     chat in room, chat in interest groups, chat with everyone...

<li> The protocol must support a rich set of interactions with the
     virtual environment.  Supported interactions include avatar motion
     and actions, manipulation of whiteboard/chalkboard, etc.

<li> The protocol must support a rich set of interactions with computer
     science educational applications, such as text editors and compilers.
     These tools will be integrated into the environment; we do not have
     to work with existing tools unmodified.

<li> The protocol must be somewhat concise.  Later versions may include
     compression on large packets.

</li><li> The protocol must be somewhat secure.  Later versions may include
     encryption.  More likely, we will use ssh tunnels.

</li></ul>


<h3> Design </h3>

The protocol design section should include syntax of messages in general;
sort of the general packet parsing.  It starts with

<pre>

\command arguments* \n

</pre>

Most commands are short, but some commands are quite long, including tasks
such as sending messages with many text lines in them. Newlines are escaped
(or mangled, if you prefer) in such messages.  TCP does not guarantee delivery
of an entire command in a single packet. The client and server must queue up
incoming unfinished commands until their newline is received.  Multiple
commands are generally batched into a single packet in order to reduce
OS overhead.


<h3> Protocol Message Types by Example </h3>

These examples convey the flavor of the protocol.
This list is not complete nor entirely correct.
Things that are/were planned but not implemented should be moved
down to the future work section.

<p>

Some of these items
are really local client commands, not network protocol commands.  For each
command we need to ask: does it need to go the server?  and then: which
client(s) should the server forward it on to?  and then: does it require
a reply, and if so, from whom?  Lastly: for each command, does it require
that the server remember the state change and store it in a database?
<p>

Every command can be abbreviated by a unique prefix.  Common commands can
be abbreviated with nonunique prefixes. Each client avatar has a current
default command which executes for lines not beginning with \.

<h4> Establishing groups </h4>

There are the following types of grouns:

<dl>
<dt> session
<dd> A session is a temporary membership chat group for the current-session.
     An ICI collaborative file-editing session ought to be (but is not yet)
     a special case of this which has associated files being edited.
<dt> sig
<dd> This is the persistent membership, generic chat group
<dt> course
<dt> This is a persistent membership group with extra structure
and permissions for academic courses.
</dl>

<h4> File Transfer </h4>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th> Example </th><th> Description
</th></tr><tr><td> \putfile dat/avatars/curtis.avt 206 </td><td>
dat/avatars/curtis.avt is the file to upload, and it is 206 bytes.
Immediately after the newline (after the 6) the actual contents of the
file (ASCII or binary; use writes()/reads() for no newline-handling)
would be sent.
</td></tr><tr><td> \getfile dat/avatars/curtis.avt </td><td> this asks the server
to execute a \putfile

</td></tr></tbody></table>

Issues:
<ul>
<li> for large files, break reads/writes up into chunks and service other
active connections while transfer is in progress.  Under such a
circumstance, connection/session manager has to remember for a given
connection that it has a file transfer in-progress and new data is not a new
command.
</li><li> permissions model: do not allow this at chat command line!
</li><li> private file transfer: \putfile userid dat/...
</li></ul>

<h4> Miscellaneous </h4>

</th></tr><tr><td> \quit!          </td><td> exits immediately
</td></tr><tr><td> \exit           </td><td> exits with a grace period
</td></tr><tr><td> \afk            </td><td> marks you as away from keyboard
</td></tr><tr><td> \who            </td><td> show who is on the system

</td></tr><tr><td> \loc            </td><td> shows your current location
</td></tr><tr><td> \log [on off]   </td><td> turns on/off your private recorder
</td></tr><tr><td> \cmd say        </td><td> sets the default command to \say

</td></tr><tr><td> \give joe voice </td><td> give joe permission to speak
</td></tr><tr><td> \give joe legs  </td><td> give joe permission to move

</td></tr><tr><td> \take joe ...   </td><td> remove students' specific permissions
</td></tr><tr><td> \stop joe       </td><td> remove all of joe's permissions, he is paralyzed
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h4> Administrator tasks </h4>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th> Example         </th><th> Description

</th></tr><tr><td> \enroll joe cs371 </td><td> adds joe to a class

</td></tr><tr><td> \lock joe         </td><td> prevents joe from logging in any more
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3> Collaborative IDE and Browser Protocol </h3>

Issues:

<ul>
<li> two sources of changes need to be transmitted: changes from the
     textlist (or editabletextlist, or htmlbrowser) widget, and changes
     from the scrollbar.  Except: scrollbar changes already propagate
     to the textlist widget, so perhaps we can catch them there.
</li><li> commands messages vs. content messages
</li><li> how often do commands synchronize?
</li><li> who is keeping track of who-all is in the collaborative session
</li><li> who is keeping track of who owns the write "token"
</li><li> commands for requesting and releasing the write "token"
</li><li> Refactoring of groups to support: chat, voice, and browsing/editing groups

</li><li> Invitation-based session creation.
</li></ul>


<h3> Future Work </h3>

<h4> UDP </h4>

Those interactions which are transient (e.g. avatar motion) are appropriate
for a UDP subsystem.

<h4> Model Editing </h4>

The purpose of a Model Editing subsystem in the protocol is to allow dynamic
changes to the CVE model to be seen by others.  A module that is of particular
interest in planning for such a protocol is model/CVEBuilder.icn, which
reads/parses .dat files and constructs virtual objects from them.

Some basic issues include:
<ul>
<li> should a single server process support multiple
models, such that someone can login to model A and within it, create a
model B.
<li> how to error check each creation or edit
<li> whether to bundle certain edits explicitly in the protocol. For example,
     suppose you push a wall to increase a room's size -- the room(s)
     behind the wall should probably shrink correspondingly, or reject such
     an edit.
</ul>

<tbody>
<tr><th> Editing Message         </th><th> Description
<tr><td> \make class name params <td> create a new virtual object
<tr><td> \move name params <td> alter coordinates of virtual object
<tr><td> \edit name param=val ... <td> alter attributes of virtual object
<tr><td> \texture dat/uidaho/jeb121/sign.gif ... <td> upload a texture

Examples:
<pre>
\make Room bedroom5 13.2 0 11 5 3.3 4.4

\edit bedroom5 floor=floor.gif
