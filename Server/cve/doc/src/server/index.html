<em>Editor's note: the introductory prose for this chapter is really just a
placeholder so far, each chapter will be expanded to include design
documentation in such a section.  This prose will be added in CVS in a
cve/doc/src/index.html and subdirectory index.html files.</em>

<p>
The server/ directory contains the CVE server, currently named cved,
along with auxiliary helper applications:
<dl>
<dt> account_admin
<dd> provides a
command-line administrative access to the server for tasks such as
account creation.
<dt> watchdog
<dd> checks continuously (every 5 seconds by default) to verify that the
cved server is still responding, and if not, attempts to kill and restart it.
</dl>
<p>

The server directory also contains a subdirectory with a utility to
assist in starting the server as a background daemon so that it will
run without a console shell process.
