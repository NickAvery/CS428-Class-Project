The ide/ directory contains CVE's collaborative integrated development
environment, called ICI.  Much of this code duplicates, in part, elements
that appear elsewhere in the Unicon source distribution, such as the
Unicon translator front-end (used for syntax coloring) and the GUI code
that ICI shares with Unicon's standalone IDE, ui.
