<em>Editor's note: the introductory prose for this chapter is really just a
placeholder so far, each chapter will be expanded to include design
documentation in such a section.  This prose will be added in CVS in a
cve/doc/src/index.html and subdirectory index.html files.</em>

<p>
The client/ directory contains the client consisting of two executables,
currently named cve and nsh.  Although it is the default program
you run in order to run the CVE, cve is actually just a "patcher" program,
capable of downloading updated client files from a website.  Unfortunately,
it is a pain to maintain the patcher's website with constantly updated files,
and the patcher will not be a wise tool to enable by default until relevant
files have reasonable timestamp and version number checking in place.
The cve launcher  has another role: selecting what server you are logging
into, by hostname:port or ip#:port.
<p>

nsh (actually named nsh.cmd) is the actual CVE client program.  It is a .cmd
file to document clearly that it does not include the Unicon virtual machine,
which is downloadable/patchable separately.  nsh links extensively to other
directories, specifically the model/ and ide/ directories.
