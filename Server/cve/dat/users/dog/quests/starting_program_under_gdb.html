<p>
Use the run command to start your program under GDB. You must first specify 
the program name with an argument to GDB.
<p>
The execution of a program is affected by certain information it receives 
from its superior. GDB provides ways to specify this information, which 
you must do before starting your program. (You can change it after 
starting your program, but such changes only affect your program the 
next time you start it.) This information may be divided into four 
categories.
<p>
The arguments.<br>
Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the run 
command. If a shell is available on your target, the shell is used to 
pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions (such as 
wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing the 
arguments. In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the 
SHELL environment variable.
<p>
The environment.<br>
Your program normally inherits its environment from GDB, but you can use 
the GDB commands set environment and unset environment to change parts 
of the environment that affect your program.
<p>
The working directory.<br>
Your program inherits its working directory from GDB. You can set the 
GDB working directory with the cd command in GDB.
<p>
The standard input and output.<br>
Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and 
standard output as GDB is using. You can redirect input and output in 
the run command line, or you can use the tty command to set a different 
device for your program.
