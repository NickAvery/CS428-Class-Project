<p>
You can always ask GDB itself for information on its commands, using the command help.
<p>
You can use help (abbreviated h) with no arguments to display a short list f named classes of commands.
<p>
help class<br>
Using one of the general help classes as an argument, you can get a list 
of the individual commands in that class. For example, here is the help 
display for the class status.
<p>
help command<br>
With a command name as help argument, GDB displays a short paragraph on 
how to use that command.
<p>
In addition to help, you can use the GDB commands info and show to inquire 
about the state of your program, or the state of GDB itself. Each 
command supports many topics of inquiry; this manual introduces each of 
them in the appropriate context. The listings under info and under show 
in the Index point to all the sub-commands.
<p>
info<br>
This command (abbreviated i) is for describing the state of your 
program. For example, you can show the arguments passed to a function 
with info args.
<p>
show<br>
In contrast to info, show is for describing the state of GDB itself. You 
can change most of the things you can show, by using the related command 
set; for example, you can control what number system is used for 
displays with set radix, or simply inquire which is currently in use 
with show radix.
<p>
show version<br>
Show what version of GDB is running. You should include this information 
in GDB bug-reports. If multiple versions of GDB are in use at your site, 
you may need to determine which version of GDB you are running; as GDB 
evolves, new commands are introduced, and old ones may wither away. 
Also, many system vendors ship variant versions of GDB, and there are 
variant versions of GDB in GNU/Linux distributions as well. The version 
number is the same as the one announced when you start GDB.
<p>
show copying<br>
info copying<br>
Display information about permission for copying GDB.
<p>
show warranty<br>
info warranty<br>
Display the GNU "NO WARRANTY" statement, or a warranty, if your version 
of GDB comes with one.
