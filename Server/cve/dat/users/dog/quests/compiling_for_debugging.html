In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate debugging 
information when you compile it. This debugging information is stored in the 
object file; it describes the data type of each variable or function and the 
correspondence between source line numbers and addresses in the executable code.
<p>
To request debugging information, specify the -g option when you run the compiler.
<p>
You can always ask GDB itself for information on its commands, using the
command help; it prints a list of all possible commands in the current 
debugging situation, the list includes a brief description of each command.
Furthermore, "help command" prints you a complete description of the command
"command" and its possible arguments.
<p>
Many compilers are unable to handle the -g and -O 
options together. Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized 
executables containing debugging information. GCC, the GNU C/C++ 
compiler, supports `-g' with or without `-O', making it possible to 
debug optimized code. We recommend that you always use `-g' whenever you 
compile a program. You may think your program is correct, but there is 
no sense in pushing your luck
<p>
When you debug a program compiled with `-g -O', remember that the optimizer 
is rearranging your code; the debugger shows you what is really there. 
Do not be too surprised when the execution path does not exactly match 
your source file! An extreme example: if you define a variable, but 
never use it, GDB never sees that variable--because the compiler 
optimizes it out of existence.
     
<dt> Quiz (4/6)
<dd>
<dl>
<dt> Does GDB require any special compilation for your program? (Multiple Choice)
<dd> Yes (TRUE)
<dd> No
<dt> Can you load a program compiled without the -g option under GDB? (Multiple Choice)
<dd> Yes (TRUE)
<dd> No
<dt> What does the -g option do to your compiled program?
<dd> add debugging information to the object code
<dt> What does the -O option do to your compiled program?
<dd> optimize it
