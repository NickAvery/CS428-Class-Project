The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your 
program before it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into trouble, you 
can investigate and find out why.<br>
<p>
Inside GDB, your program may stop for any of several reasons, such as a signal, 
a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a GDB command such as step. You may 
then examine and change variables, set new breakpoints or remove old ones, and 
then continue execution. Usually, the messages shown by GDB provide ample 
explanation of the status of your program--but you can also explicitly request 
this information at any time using the "info program" command that displays 
information about the status of your program: whether it is running or not, what 
process it is, and why it stopped.
