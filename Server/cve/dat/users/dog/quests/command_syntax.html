<dt> Reading
<dd> A GDB command is a single line of input. There is no limit on how long it 
can be. It starts with a command name, which is followed by arguments whose 
meaning depends on the command name. For example, the command step accepts an 
argument which is the number of times to step, as in `step 5'. You can also use 
the step command with no arguments. Some commands do not allow any arguments.
<p>
GDB command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is 
unambiguous. Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the 
documentation for individual commands. In some cases, even ambiguous 
abbreviations are allowed; for example, s is specially defined as 
equivalent to step even though there are other commands whose names 
start with s. You can test abbreviations by using them as arguments to 
the help command.
<p> 
A blank line as input to GDB (typing just RET) means to repeat the previous 
command. Certain commands (for example, run) will not repeat this way; 
these are commands whose unintentional repetition might cause trouble 
and which you are unlikely to want to repeat. User-defined commands can 
disable this feature.
<p>
The list and x commands, when you repeat them with RET, construct new 
arguments rather than repeating exactly as typed. This permits easy 
scanning of source or memory.
<p>
GDB can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is only 
one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities are 
for the next word in a command, at any time. This works for GDB 
commands, GDB subcommands, and the names of symbols in your program.
<p>
Press the TAB key whenever you want GDB to fill out the rest of a word. If 
there is only one possibility, GDB fills in the word, and waits for you 
to finish the command (or press RET to enter it).
