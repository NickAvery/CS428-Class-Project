<p>Rather than deleting a breakpoint you might prefer to disable it. This makes 
the breakpoint inoperative as if it had been deleted, but remembers the 
information on the breakpoint so that you can enable it again later.
<p>
You disable and enable breakpoints with the enable and disable commands, 
optionally specifying one or more breakpoint numbers as arguments. Use info 
break to print a list of breakpoints if you do not know which numbers to use.
<p>
Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations affects all of 
its locations.
<p>
A breakpoint can have any of four different states of enablement:
<p> * Enabled. The breakpoint stops your program. A breakpoint set with the break command starts out in this state.
<p> * Disabled. The breakpoint has no effect on your program.
<p> * Enabled once. The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes disabled.
<p> * Enabled for deletion. The breakpoint stops your program, but immediately after 
it does so it is deleted permanently. A breakpoint set with the tbreak command 
starts out in this state.
<p> You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints:
<p> disable [breakpoints] [range...]
<p> Disable the specified breakpoints--or all breakpoints, if none are listed. A 
disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten. All options such as 
ignore-counts, conditions and commands are remembered in case the breakpoint is 
enabled again later. You may abbreviate disable as dis.
<p> enable [breakpoints] [range...]
<p> Enable the specified breakpoints (or all defined breakpoints). They become 
effective once again in stopping your program.
<p>
enable [breakpoints] once range...
<p>
Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily. GDB disables any of these 
breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.
<p>
enable [breakpoints] delete range...
<p>
Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die. GDB deletes any of 
these breakpoints as soon as your program stops there. <br>
