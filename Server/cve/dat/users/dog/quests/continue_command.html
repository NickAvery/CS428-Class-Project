<p>Continuing means resuming program execution until your program completes 
normally. Your program may stop even sooner, due to a breakpoint

<dd> 
<p>continue [ignore-count]
<p>c [ignore-count]
<p>fg [ignore-count]
<p>
Resume program execution, at the address where your program last stopped; any 
breakpoints set at that address are bypassed. The optional argument ignore-count 
allows you to specify a further number of times to ignore a breakpoint at this 
location; its effect is like that of ignore (see section Break Conditions).
<p>
The argument ignore-count is meaningful only when your program stopped due to a 
breakpoint. At other times, the argument to continue is ignored.
<p>
The synonyms c and fg (for foreground, as the debugged program is deemed to be 
the foreground program) are provided purely for convenience, and have exactly 
the same behavior as continue.
<p>
A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint at the beginning 
of the function or the section of your program where a problem is believed to 
lie, run your program until it stops at that breakpoint, and then examine the 
variables that are interesting.
