<p>break
<p>When called without any arguments, "break" sets a breakpoint at the next 
instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame. In any selected frame 
but the innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control returns to 
that frame. This is similar to the effect of a finish command in the frame 
inside the selected frame--except that finish does not leave an active 
breakpoint. If you use break without an argument in the innermost frame, GDB 
stops the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful inside 
loops.
<p>
GDB normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at least one 
instruction has been executed. If it did not do this, you would be unable to 
proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the breakpoint. This rule 
applies whether or not the breakpoint already existed when your program stopped.
