Debugging is the process of removing bugs from computer programs. The most 
primitive debugging process is to stare at your source code until you 
find/locate the bug. The second most primitive debugging process is to 
instrument your program with print/write statements that tells you what path and 
state your program is executing. However, debugging is more efficient when you 
use another program called debugger to help you look at your program execution.
<p>
A debugger is a program that runs other programs. The goal of a general
debugger is to help you investigate the state of your debuggee program 
by means such as breakpoints, watchpoints, stepping and continuing, and
looking up the state of the execution stack. So a debugger can be used 
to help you fix your program.
<p>
GDB is a source-level debugger. It allows you to place a breakpoint at
any specific line number or function name, watching variable values, and 
checking execution stack frames. GDB works for C, C++, Fortran, and Java
programs. In order to debug a C/C++ program with GDB, your program must 
be compiled with -g flag. This flag adds debugging symbols into your 
compiled file. If you have a larger program with several files, each must 
be compiled with the -g flag, and it must also be set when you link.
<p>
To start the debugging process, first start the debugger, which gdb, with
your program name as the first argument. i.e. prompt$ gdb program-name. 
Then use the run command in gdb to start the execution.
