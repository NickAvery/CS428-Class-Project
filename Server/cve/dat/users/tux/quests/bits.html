<dd> A bit is smallest unit of binary digital data.  It has the possible
     values 0 or 1.
     A bit can mean: numbers 0 or 1, "on" or "off", boolean True or False,
     Yes or No, "white" or "black", and so on.
     A bit is typically part of a larger value (composed of
     multiple bits), in which case the bit's value might never get used
     by itself.
