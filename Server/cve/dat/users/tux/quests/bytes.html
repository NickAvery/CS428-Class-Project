<dd> A byte is a sequence of 8 bits. It is the smallest unit of
     memory that is individually addressable on most computer-based
     hardware. There are 256 possible combinations
     of bits in a byte, ranging from 00000000 to 11111111.
     A byte can be interpreted as any distinct
     values you like, so long the range has &lt;= 256 values.
     A byte may store: eight separate true/false values;
     a number from 0 to 255 or -128 to 127; or, commonly, a single character
     symbol encoded using some character set, such as ASCII, the American
     Standard Code for Information Interchange.  Of course,
     if you want to use and store a fewer number of bits in a byte you can
     do that, and just ignore some of the bits i the byte.
