<dd> Files are named sequences of 0 or more bytes.  There are an infinite
     number of ways to organize the information in a file, called
     file formats. The most common file formats are either "text files"
     or "binary files".  In the case of text files, the contents of the
     file are interpreted as human-readable symbols, organized into lines,
     separated by newline characters. On UNIX (and Linux) systems, the
     newline character is an ASCII control-J (binary 10).  In the case of
     binary
     files, the bytes are usually not human-readable, but instead they
     may contain machine code or numeric data in its fastest, binary form.
     <p>
     Files are named according to the rules of the operating system and
     media on which they are stored. Most platforms restrict file names
     so that they must be made of visible and printable characters, and
     may disallow file names with odd punctuation.
     Some platforms have limits on the length of the file names.
     Some platforms distinguish between upper and lower case characters
     in file names, and some do not.
     <p>
     Many platforms use a convention in which a period (.) separates the
     main part of the filename (the base name) from an optional suffix
     called the file extension.  The file extension indicates the file
     format and type of information stored in the file, although mistakes
     can happen.
