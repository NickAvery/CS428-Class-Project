<dd> Unlike Windows, UNIX systems such as Linux were designed to be multi-user
     timesharing systems from their very beginning.  The name UNIX itself was
     intended to suggest a simplified version of a fancier multi-user operating
     system called Multics which was created in the 1960's.

     <p>
     In order to use a UNIX system, you must login. To login, you supply
     your user name and password. But where do they come from?  The answer
     almost invariably is: from the person who runs (administers) the UNIX
     system that you are going to use.  If you install UNIX yourself, during
     the install process you are generally asked to create the account for
     the system administrator (a user named "root"), who can then create
     accounts for normal use.

     <p>
     When an account is created, several pieces of information about the
     user are entered. To login, the important pieces are the "user name"
     (also called "user id" or "user identification") and "password". The
     password is supposed to be a secret word or phrase that only that
     user knows.

     <p>
     When your account is first created, your password is usually assigned
     by the system administrator, who tells you what user name and password
     to use.
