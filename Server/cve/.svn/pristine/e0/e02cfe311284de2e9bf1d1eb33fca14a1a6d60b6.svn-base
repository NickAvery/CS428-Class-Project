CHANGELOG for Unicron CVE
-------------------------

tachtek
2/17/2005   (BUGFIX) The server now disallows duplicate user logins.

tachtek
2/16/2005   (FEATURE) new error reporting mechanism. Please make note. From now
            on all success/failure responses headed for the client should go out
            in the following fashion.

		sendRaw(sock, "success message description if any", "success")  or
		sendRaw(sock, "error message description", "failure")

            to decode them on the client side please make use of the following
       	    methodololy:

		cmds := Commands()

		result := read(net) # grab server response
		if status := cmds.wasSuccessfull(result)  then
		{		
		   write("this means that the command succeeded")
		   write(status)
		}
		else
		   fail

		OR

		if error := cmds.wasUnSuccessfull(result)  then
	        {
		   write(error)
		   fail
		}

            It is important that we have a common server response mechanism.

tachtek
2/ /2005    (FEATURE) \download fucntionality is working. Now the new users can
            automatically log in by enabling the other logged in client to download
            the new avatars dynamically.

tachtek
2/ /2005    (FEATURE) UDP functionality

tachtek
2/10/2005   (GENERAL) the account listing in account_admin are now being sorted
	    before displayed!

tachtek
2/10/2005   (GENERAL) per Jeffery request, the log time stamp was converted to 
	    short form.

tachtek
2/10/2005   (BUGFIX) established a signal handling mechanism in which SIGPIPEs are
            caught and graciously handled. No more "Broken Pipes" can the client
	    crashes.

tachtek
2/10/2005   (GENERAL) the deprecated methods Broadcast_* have finally been removed.
            I (Kosta) had left them in there for about a month after I replaced
            them with the sendto* new style of network message passing. They are 
            gone as of today!

tachtek
2/10/2005   (BUGFIX) a typo would make the server freeze when the account admin
            tool requests for a user password change. The typo is fixed and now
            it works smoothly.

tachtek
2/9/2005    (FEATURE) "\uptime" is operational. It returns the uptime properties of 
            the unicrond server.

tachtek
2/4/2005    (FEATURE) streamlining of account creation is done. no documentation
            at this point.

tachtek     
1/31/2005   (GENERAL) in an effort to streamline account creation it came
            to my head that the chat window might not always be open when
            somebody wants to create a new user. The best way to accomplish
            this requirement was to abstract out the connection details
            so that no matter what UI is being built, the developers can use
            the connectionHandler class to homogeniously connect to the server
            and do their business. I did just that. I tested it to a certain
            extent so please let me know of any weird behavior.

tachtek
1/28/2005   THIS METHOD HAS BEEN DEPRECATED!
            (FEATURE) this is the first step at allowing any client to 
	    create new users. The syntax on the client side looks like this.
 
		\login uid passwd new   # the new MUST be there in order to work

            This tell the server that we want to create a new user with those
	    credentials. This required the least amount of code, but it might
            change in the near future. At this point only the necessary
	    db stuff is created. Still working on the best method to upload
            the files. The \upload functionality stays the same.

tachtek
1/26/2005   (BUGFIX) the server should not crash anymore when the close
            button is pressed on the 3D window. Rather it should issue
            a logout for the user, if a user is logged in and get out of
	    there with an exit(0). The error on the server used to be a
            Broken Pipe error. The fix? a short delay statement to ensure
            the completion of \logout before the close(net).
            Can somebody test it on window?

tachtek
1/24/2005   (FEATURE) method fileXferInitiate(filename) is available to
	    the client. Now when there is a new account created the client
	    is going to be able to upload the new amaker files to the server.
	    In the appropriate place and appropriate scope make a call to
            fileXferInitiate("dat/avatars/newuser.gif") and the file will be
            uploaded to the server under the same directory hierarchy. 
            The method figures out the size and whether the file exists and
            issues an upload request which looks similar to this:

                   \upload dat/avatars/newuser.gif 483

	    From there on the server makes sure that a version of this file
            does not already exists and also that the user has permission to 
	    write to that directory. If those checks succeed the server
            issues back a:
                
                   \upload dat/avatars/newuser.gif 483 4511

            where 4511 is the port that it is listening on for the data. The
            client then executes fileXferPerform(args) in which it open, reads
            the file, and opens a connection to that port and feeds the file.
            Once done the server closes the connection and writes the file
            to the filesystem.

            Port negotiation is handled by a new class called the portHandler.
            Under defaults.icn there are some constants defined which dictate
            how many extra ports are available to unicrond and which ones they
            are. portHandler automatically figures out which ports are available
            and hands them out to different file transfers. By default I have
            set 10 extra ports with the starting one being 4510. Once trasmission
            is over, the port resources are reclaimed. 

            PLEASE TEST THIS FEATURE! IT MIGHT NEED REVISIONS.

tachtek
1/22/2005   (FEATURE) "\join group_name" has been integrated. At this point
            if the group exists it simply adds the user as a member of the
	    groups otherwise it creates the group and then does the add.
            It also notifies other groups members of new members.

tachtek
01/21/2005  (FEATURE) "\groups" functionality now in unicron. Invoking
            this commands returns the names of the groups that the
            user is currently enrolled in. Joing a group is coming
            shortly.

tachtek
01/19/2005  (FEATURE) "\ignore user" and "\allow user" functionality
            has been integrated.

tachtek
01/17/2005: (FEATURE) "\tell user message" functionality integrated.
            Please test.

tachtek
01/05/2005: (BUGFIX) the second user who would try to log on would
	    send the server in limbo. This is fixed.
            the problem: the replacements to the Broadcast calls were 
                         buggy.

tachtek
12/27/2004: (FEATURE) replace most of the Broadcast* calls to
            the new and improved sendto* calls. Anymore we should
            not be getting the annoying "No user to talk to"
            on the chatwindow. This needs more debugging.

tachtek
12/25/2004: (FEATURE) Merry Christmas. Pressing the window close 
            button on the chat windows does not make the app throw 
            up anymore.
            the problem: the -11 (WM_CLOSE) event was not handled 
                         properly now it is handled like a "\close"

tachtek
12/24/2004: (FEATURE) account_admin tool has been integrated. 
            Maybe it should be moved to the client subdirectory 
            since it contains client-side code.
            usage: run "account_admin server:port username password"

tachtek
12/22/2004: (FEATURE) server logging mechanism integrated
            usage: when you want to log something use the 
                   function called logit( ... ) and pass a 
                   descriptive message of your log. The 
                   mechanism will append chronological attributes 
                   and log your entry in tmp.log. Tail the logs
                   to monitor the server's behavior.

tachtek
12/21/2004: (BUGFIX) \logout does not crash the server anymore, 
            rather it works as expected.
            the problem: \logout was not handled properly at 
                         all. The function handling was not complete

tachtek
12/20/2004: (FEATURE) modified command \login to work with 
            authentication usage: \login: "\login password" 
	    (the username is taken from \avatar uid)

tachtek
12/18/2004: (FEATURE) integrated user authentication

tachtek
12/17/2004: (BUGFIX) finally corrected the window event errors
            that only impacted the linux client. The set_window
            function is very dangerous. Upon consulting with 
	    jeffery from now on we should pass the target window
            to the drawing function and not make assumptions about
	    what the default window is.

tachtek
12/16/2004: (BUGFIX) \close does not result in a runtime error 
            anymore.
            the problem: there was no command to remove the chat 
                         window from the event list

tachtek
12/14/2004: (FEATURE) default server is set to "localhost:4500" 
            for sanity reasons.
     	    the problem: this was not really a bug, trick me once...
