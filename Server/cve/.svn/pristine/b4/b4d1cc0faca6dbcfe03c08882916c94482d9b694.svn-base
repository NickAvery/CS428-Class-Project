Debugging is the process of removing bugs from computer programs. The
simplest debugging process is to stare at your source code until you locate
the bug. The second most primitive debugging process is to litter your
program with print/write statements that tell that values of interesting
variables where your program is executing. However, debugging is more
efficient when you use another program called debugger to help you look at
your program execution.

<p>

GDB is a very popular debugger. It is free software, protected by the GNU
General Public License (GPL).

<p>
The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on 
inside another program while it executes, or what it was doing at 
the moment it crashed. GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things 
in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
<p>
* Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
<p>
* Make your program stop on specified conditions.
<p>
* Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
<p>
* Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the 
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
<p> You can use GDB to debug programs written in C and C++.
