* What it is:

CVE is a collaborative virtual environment for education, especially
computer science. It is a combination of a Multiuser Online 3D world
and a collaborative integrated development environment.

* Requirements:

 - ANSI C compiler and "make" tool.
   -- Unix: cc or gcc. Windows: MinGW gcc
 - Unicon, from unicon.org
 - OpenGL libraries, headers, and drivers

* How to compile:

- Windows: You can get the binaries from sourceforge:
  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/cve/files/

- You can grab the source from sourceforge:

  svn checkout https://cve.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cve/trunk/cve

  Given a working installation of C and unicon on your path,
  CVE builds from its sources by saying: make.  That builds both a
  client and a server, but you probably mainly want the client, it
  lives in the cve/bin directory and is named "cve".

* Questions ?

  Questions and Comments can be posted to the cve-group mailing list,
  cve-group@lists.sf.net.
