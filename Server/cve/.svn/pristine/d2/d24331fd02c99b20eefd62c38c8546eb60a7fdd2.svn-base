CVE is an open-source, multiplatform system for building low-cost
collaborative virtual environments. Its primary support and development
is taking place at the 
<A href="http://www.uidaho.edu">University of Idaho</A>
<A href="http://www.cs.uidaho.edu">Department of Computer Science</A>.
CVE started life at
<A href="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~jeffery/vcsc/">New Mexico State University</A>
with support from NSF grant 0402572.

<h4> What's New? </h4>

<ul>
<li> Concurrency brings dramatic improvements to CVE client and server for folks
     with multicore machines. This is a result of Jafar Al Gharaibeh's Ph.D.
     research (July 2012).
<li> UI's new aggressive firewall policies shut off our virtual.cs.uidaho.edu
     (primary server's)
     accessibility from off campus in early 2012. We've moved to a temporary
     host server and are evaluating new server home alternatives.
</ul>

<p>

We want to enable you to build virtual editions
of your academic or organizational units.  The CVE distributions
so far include the <A href="nmsucsdept.gif">NMSU CS department</A> within
<A href="http://www.nmsu.edu/General/Maps/buildings/science.html">Science Hall</A> and the University of Idaho CS Department in the
Janssen Engineering Building.
<p>

The Facilities Office at most colleges and universities have CAD data files
with more accurate representations of buildings. These help
a Lot if you can get them, however, they are often not public for security
reasons.
CVE enables you to do a virtual CS department with less, starting from
floor plans.  Often you do not need to model the entire building. For example,
at NMSU we are mainly interested in the <a href="sh1.gif">1st Floor</A>,
while at Idaho we needed portions of every storey in the building.
<p>

<A name="virtualplease">
Before modeling an entire building, you may want to model just a single room
to get the hang of it.
CVE's first room was NMSU's Programming
Languages, Environments, and Automated Software Engineering Lab,
located in Science Hall Room 167, a 12'x20' room
(ceiling approximately 9' high) with a whiteboard, 4-5 workstations, and
a printer.  This demo went through many revisions before expanding to a
department-wide demo.

CVE requires a reasonably fast OpenGL implementation in order to run
well. Don't expect great performance on machines with integrated graphics
or software OpenGL implementations. You may need to install drivers
to get hardware acceleration for good OpenGL performance. Some operating
systems seem to have crippled OpenGL deliberately, such as Windows Vista.
We have tried hard to make CVE run as well as possible on available
hardware, such as customizing it for a CS summer camp on a room full of
integrated graphics laptops at NMSU.

<font size=5><li> CVE SVN Source Distribution</font>
<p>

CVE is free to everyone, under the GPL. Help yourself to the public
distributions, which are not claimed to be finished or polished.
To download and run CVE, follow these instructions:
<ul>
<li> Download and install the Unicon programming language from
     <A href="http://unicon.org">unicon.org</A>.  You may have
     to install some 3D (OpenGL or Mesa) development packages
     containing header files and libraries if you need to build
     Unicon from source and want it to build a working CVE client.
<li> Obtain a SVN client, if you need one.  Although graphical SVN
     clients like Tortoise exist, we recommend command line versions
     due to occasional problems we have encountered.
<li> Execute
<pre>
  svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/cve/code/trunk/cve
</pre>
This will create a subdirectory cve under
whatever directory you do it from, so you may want to "cd" somewhere first.
<li> cd into cve subdirectory you have just checked out
<li> type "make".  This assumes you have a good working "make" or "make.exe" on your path
<li> cd into bin subdirectory
<li> type "./cve" (Linux/Unix/MacOS) or "cve" (Windows)
</ul>
<p>

We welcome source code corrections, bug reports, and offers of collaboration.

CVE has gone through a few names, it was once "nsh", standing for
"New Science Hall", or perhaps
"new shell", since the collaborative virtual environment we are building
will eventually constitute an entire working environment.  Then it was
Unicron, playing on the name of its underlying implementation language
(Unicon). For awhile
we wanted to call it VIEW.  But ultimately these other names either are
other folks' properties or don't fit us perfectly.  CVE is a generic term
for collaborative virtual environment and we do not claim it for ourselves,
but it was available on source forge and is a good fit, so we took it.
