<p>

The list of requirements for any collaborative virtual environment will
be large, and CVE is no exception.  Many of the requirements can be
culled from the original NSF proposal.
<p>

Requirements include:

<dl>
<dt> 3D graphics and animation must achieve a playable experience
<dd> while the graphics quality standard is not commercial grade, it
     must look good enough and be fast enough to attract users.
<dt> 3D places and people must be recognizable
<dd> education in actuality takes place in a mixed and augmented reality,
     not a pure virtual reality.  The correspondence to the real world
     need not be strict, but the system should resemble reality.
     For faculty, this serves to minimize the cognitive load. For future
     transfer students, it familiarizes them with the real place before
     they arrive.
<dt> the system must scale to handle whole courses (30+ people)
<dt> the system must be usable for lectures
<dt> a collaborative IDE must allow instructors to assist students
     sufficiently to conduct effective labs and office hours.

<p>

A use case analysis extends and formalizes what was stated in plain text
prose.  It provides a starting point for an object-oriented design of the
system.
