It is often necessary to eliminate a breakpoint once it has done its job and 
you no longer want your program to stop there. This is called deleting the 
breakpoint. A breakpoint that has been deleted no longer exists; it is 
forgotten.
<p>
With the clear command you can delete breakpoints according to where they are in 
your program. With the delete command you can delete individual breakpoints by 
specifying their breakpoint numbers.
<p>
It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it. GDB automatically 
ignores breakpoints on the first instruction to be executed when you continue 
execution without changing the execution address.
<p>
clear
<p>
Deletes any breakpoint at the next instruction to be executed in the selected 
stack frame. When the innermost frame is selected, this is a good way to delete 
a breakpoint where your program just stopped.
<p>
clear location
<p>
Deletes any breakpoint set at the specified location.
<p>
clear function
<p>
clear filename:function
<p>
Deletes any breakpoint set at entry to the named function.
<p>
clear linenum<br>
clear filename:linenum<br>
Deletes any breakpoint set at or within the code of the specified linenum of the 
specified filename. <br>
<br>
delete [breakpoints] [range...]<br>
Deletes the breakpoint of the breakpoint ranges specified as arguments. If no 
argument is specified, delete all breakpoints (GDB asks confirmation, unless you 
have set confirm off). You can abbreviate this command as d .<br>
