<p>
To exit GDB, use the quit command (abbreviated q), or type an end-of-file 
character (usually Ctrl-d). If you do not supply expression, GDB will terminate 
normally; otherwise it will terminate using the result of expression as the 
error code.
<p>
An interrupt (often Ctrl-c) does not exit from GDB, but rather terminates 
the action of any GDB command that is in progress and returns to GDB 
command level. It is safe to type the interrupt character at any time 
because GDB does not allow it to take effect until a time when it is 
safe.
