Collaborative virtual environments are
networked multi-user 3D persistent virtual worlds.  This software category
includes multi-user virtual reality systems, but the largest virtual
environments run on ordinary PC hardware.  This book documents the
implementation of CVE, a collaborative virtual environment written in
the Unicon programming language, from www.unicon.org.  CVE was developed
with the support of an NSF Advanced Technological Education (ATE) award. Its
goal is to improve Computer Science education opportunities for students
located at a distance from their instructors.  <p>

The original inspiration for Unicron came after a series of fortunate
events. In 1999 a student in San Antonio introduced me to collaborative
virtual environments by means of EverQuest, a leader in the new genre of
Massively Multiplayer Role Playing Games.  I lost about two years of my
life playing EverQuest in Las Vegas, partly because it <em>is</em> that
addicting, and partly because I was in a post-tenure-denial depression.
<p>

After I moved to New Mexico in 2001 I quit playing EverQuest, but the genre
had captured my attention.  I believed that this new extremely compelling
software medium was was ripe for application to many important application
domains beyond gaming, but was frustrated that I could not undertake any
software effort that large. There was no reasonable way for me to experiment
with virtual environments.

<p>

Since my teen years I had wanted to be able to write programs like this, but
was stymied in two respects: the PC hardware was not capable of achieving
the vision, and the complexity of such software was enormous.  EverQuest
proved that PC hardware was ready, but it was a multi-year, multi-million
dollar venture. The software development cost was a huge barrier to entry
that precluded the individual or small group from innovating.  The research
challenge posed by this problem is to lower the cost barriers of entry for
developing collaborative virtual environments.

<p>

Fortunately, I had spent the past 10 years creating what I felt was
the ultimate game programming language, called Unicon, and all it lacked
were the 3D graphics capabilities needed for virtual environments.  From
2002-2003 a pair of remarkable Hispanic undergraduate students, Naomi
Martinez and Nolan Clayton, pushed my dream forward. Naomi added high level
3D graphics built atop OpenGL and Nolan wrote a prototype collaborative
text editor.  They were funded by
the Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program.  Thanks to Naomi
and Nolan, when my department suggested doing some kind of grant with
distance education in 2004, I had a credible idea (a virtual
environment for distance education) and was able to parlay the prototypes
into a grant to build CVE.
<p>

Two years and a dozen or so graduate students later, the book you are now
reading started to take form.  CVE is still not finished.  It grew from
5,000 to 30,000 to 45,000
lines of code, not large by industry standards but large for a Unicon
program--- large enough that developers need navigational assistance,
especially new developers joining the team.  The book is a semi-automatic
blend of developer documentation and source code, reminiscent of a literate
programming effort but without mixing all of the prose into the source
code.  Chapters 2 and 3 contain requirements and design documents, while
Chapters 4-8 present major subsystems of Unicron organized by the source code
directories and files.  The book itself is incomplete, but I hope it will
be useful anyhow.
