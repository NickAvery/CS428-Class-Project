<dt> Reading
<dd> The UNIX system interacts with users in either a text (console) mode
     or a graphical mode. In the text mode, the screen and keyboard are
     treated by programs as special files. If you write to a special file
     called the "standard output" it shows up on your screen by default.
     If you read from a special file called the "standard input", you are
     reading from the keyboard by default.  There is actually a third special
     file called the "standard error" file; it writes to the screen and is
     intended for more serious problems such as program failures.
     <p>
     These files, because they correspond to hardware devices, have names
     in the /dev directory (for example, /dev/stdin).  One other difference
     between them and most ordinary files is that they are already open and
     ready for use when a program starts up; regular files have to be opened
     before access and closed after access.
