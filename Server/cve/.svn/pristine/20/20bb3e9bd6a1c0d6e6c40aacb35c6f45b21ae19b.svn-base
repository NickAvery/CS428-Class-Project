<font size=5><b>Sessions</b></font>

<p>

A session is a temporary relationship between a set of users that are
connected by a server with some common purpose.  Sessions are physically
represented in the client GUI by a tab in the main window area.
All sessions have a session name or identification used in the
network protocol, a list of members with associated management methods
to add or remove members, and a session manager object on the server.

<p>

There are several distinct types of sessions, at least: login sessions, chat
sessions, voip sessions, browse sessions, edit sessions, and whiteboard
sessions.
