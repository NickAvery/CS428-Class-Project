<p>
Invoke GDB by running the program gdb; such as gdb your program. Once 
started, GDB reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit. 
GDB console provides an interface between you anthe GDB session. 
You can repeat any GDB command by pressing just ENTER. You can also use 
the UP/DOWN keys to get GDB to find you a command from the list of the 
current session command history.
<p>
GDB commands can be formed in a single line of input. A command usually 
starts with a command name, then followed by zero or more arguments. 
Arguments are based on the command itself, each command has different set 
of possible arguments. A blank line as input to GDB means to repeat the 
previous command.
<p>
When GDB starts, your program is not actually running. It won't run until 
you tell GDB how to run it. Whenever the prompt "(gdb)"; appears, you can 
use the command "run"; to start your program execution.
