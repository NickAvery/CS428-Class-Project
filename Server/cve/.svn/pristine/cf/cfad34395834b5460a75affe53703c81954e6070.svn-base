The model/ directory contains the code for various kinds of virtual
objects that exist in the CVE.  These range from the entirely passive
and static (such as Walls, and Openings) to the static containers that
contain dynamic objects (Rooms) to the virtual objects that have
3d representations and dynamic behavior (Door, Pen, Book, etc.).
